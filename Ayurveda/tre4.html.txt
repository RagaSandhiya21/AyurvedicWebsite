<h1>Arthritis</h1>
<h2>Treatment for arthritis</h2>
<p>Different types of arthritis are treated by different medications. Some arthritis medications aim to
    reduce pain and inflammation. Others work on the disease process itself and aim to slow down or
    stop damage to the joints.
    The medications your doctor prescribes will depend on your type of arthritis and the severity of your
    symptoms.
    Let your doctor know about any other medications or treatments you're taking - even if you've
    purchased them from a supermarket, health store or complementary therapist (such as a naturopath
    or homeopath).
    The most common types of medications used to treat arthritis include:
    <ul>
        <li>pain-relieving medications (analgesics, such as paracetamol)-can provide temporary pain
            relief</li>
        <li>creams and ointments- can be rubbed into the skin over a painful joint to provide temporary
            pain relief</li>
        <li>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) -to control inflammation and provide
            pain relief</li>
        <li>corticosteroids - to quickly control or reduce inflammation</li>
        <li>disease-modifying anti-rheumatic medications (DMARDs)-control your overactive immune
            system</li>
        
    </ul>
</p>
