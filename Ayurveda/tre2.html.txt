<h1>Asthma</h1>
<h2>Treatment for asthma</h2>
<p>Asthma can be well controlled with the appropriate medication in most people. The main types of
    medications used to control asthma are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Relievers-</b> that act quickly to relax the muscles around the airways. This is the medication
        used during an asthma attack.</li>
   <li><b>Preventers-</b>that slowly make the airways less sensitive to triggers and reduce
    inflammation inside the airways. They are taken daily to help keep you well.</li>
    <li><b>Combination therapies-</b>that are preventers containing 2 or 3 different medicines.</li>
    <li><b>Add-on medications-</b> that help manage severe asthma. This includes monoclonal
        antibodies.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Symptoms of asthma</h2>
<p>Asthma tends to run in families. Asthma affects everyone differently, and 2 children from the same
    family can have different asthma patterns and triggers.
    Typical asthma symptoms include:
    <ul>
    <li>wheezing-a whistling noise when breathing</li>
   <li>shortness of breath</li>
    <li>a tight feeling in the chest</li>
    <li>coughing.</li>
</ul>
