<h1>Anxiety</h1>
<h2>Recovery is possible with treatment</h2>
<p>Recovery from an anxiety disorder is possible with the right treatment and support. Effective
    treatments for anxiety disorders may include:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Cognitive behavioural therapy-</b> aims to change patterns of thinking, beliefs and
    behaviours that may trigger anxiety.</li>
   <li><b>Exposure therapy-</b>involves gradually exposing a person to situations that trigger anxiety
    using a fear hierarchy: this is called systematic desensitisation.</li>
    <li><b>Anxiety management and relaxation techniques-</b>for example deep muscle relaxation,
    meditation, breathing exercises and counselling.</li>
    <li><b>Medication-</b> this may include antidepressants and benzodiazepines.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Symptoms of anxiety disorders</h2>
<p>The main features of an anxiety disorder are fears or thoughts that are chronic (constant) and
    distressing and that interfere with daily living. Other symptoms of an anxiety disorder may include:
    <ul>
    <li>Panic or anxiety attacks or a fear of these attacks.</li>
   <li>Physical anxiety reactions – for example trembling, sweating, faintness, rapid heartbeat,
    difficulties breathing or nausea.</li>
    <li>Avoidance behaviour – a person may go to extreme lengths to avoid a situation that they
        think could bring on anxiety or panic.</li>
</ul>
