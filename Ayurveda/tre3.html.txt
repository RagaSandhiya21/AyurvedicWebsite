<h1>Psoriasis</h1>
<h2>Psoriasis Ayurvedic Treatment</h2>
<p>Psoriasis is auto-immune disorder. This means it occurs when body’s own
    immune system attacks the healthy cells causing its rapid growth. The body does
    not shed these excess skin cells causing build-up of skin layers, Due to
    accelerated life cycle of cells, new skin cells are formed in days rather than
    weeks
    
    The red, scaly patches, papules, and itching plaques are the most peculiar
    Psoriasis symptoms. The skin lesions seen in Psoriasis may vary in severity and
    can be seen as small localized patches to complete body coverage. In people
    with Psoriasis the skin cells are replaced every 3 to 5 days unlike normal skin
    when the cells are replaced after 28 to 30 days.

<h2>Symptoms of Psoriasis</h2>
<p>Psoriasis patches can range from a few spots of scaly patches to major
    eruptions that cover large areas of the body. The main symptom of Psoriasis
    is red or silver scaly patches caused due to excessive division of the cells in
    the basal layers of the skin. These silver or red scaly patches often cause
    severe itching and dryness of the skin. Each type of Psoriasis may show
    different symptoms as given below:
    <ul>
    <li>Plaque Psoriasis-Patches of raised, reddish skin covered by
