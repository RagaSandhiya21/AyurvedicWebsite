<h1>Paralysis</h1>
<h2>Treatment for Paralysis</h2>

    texts. Ayurvedic treatment for Paralysis consists of several types of massages
    that relax the muscles and stimulate nerves. Therapies that Â correct vata Doshas
    also are also considered as important Ayurvedic treatment for Paralysis.
